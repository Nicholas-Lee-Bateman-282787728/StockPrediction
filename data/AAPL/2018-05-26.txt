But when you're out for revenge, $3 mil doesn't seem like much. I would have had $6 mil by then had I not sold AAPL|| 3) I did everything wrong that you can possibly think of, including enroll in StockMarketMentor, who told subscribers to "sell out of all AAPL," and I did. At the bottom. My avg share price by then was $8. It took a long time for me to trust another trading service after that.|| 2) SURPRISE My total investment of $82K had become $550k+ in 8 yrs My 125 AAPL shs became 4100 shs via splits just b4 iPhone launched Obviously, I was a genius so I began trading full time just b4 the '08 crash, using the $550k PLUS all of my IRA rolled over from JANUS~GENIUS|| 1) 1st stocks I bought in 1998-1999 were AAPL, MSFT, INTC, NVDA, CSCO, LEN & GE. When  crash hit in 2000, I averaged down a bit, then just trashed my statements, thinking I'd lost everything. When I retired mid-2007, I still had every share I ever bought.|| With past performance like this, how can you not sign up for a Free 7-day trial to  ?
