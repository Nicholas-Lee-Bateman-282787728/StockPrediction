ahhhh, so that's what it was with $ES after hours. no love lost for $AAPL anyway.  || Most $AAPL iPhone users are on the installment plan for 24-months. Any 10% tariff (IF it's even passed) would costs the average iPhone owner ONLY $5/month. It's not going to do jack to anyone's decision to buy. It's like raising the price on a MacBook by $10/month. Who cares?|| A 10% tariff on an $AAPL iPhone would cost consumers a whopping...wait for it...$5/month on the installment plan (24mth).
