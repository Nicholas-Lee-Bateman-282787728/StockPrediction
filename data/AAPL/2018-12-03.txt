Sweet I did the same with $AAPL, thinking I should have went with $AMZN instead. )||
What are the odds? The one time I explicitly, repeatedly implore AAPL for XNU 4903 sources is the one time it's "coming soon". Let's hope it's "soon"er than CF source was in previous releases, and "soon"er than AirPower.||

$AAPL Apple Ticking lower on weak guidance from supplier CRUS, watch other suppliers see 1631 comment..AAPL at... ||
Important to know that $AAPL conducted audits on all suppliers within their supply chain and apparently some were not very happy. These types of announcements could be viewed as retaliation. I take these announcemwnts with a grain of salt.||
Well, we shall read what Doug  Short AAPL  Kass has to say||

$CRUS -6% after hours on lowered revenue expectations -Expects revenue in the range of $300-$340 million vs $360-$400 million. -Cirrus Logic cited a recent weakness in the smartphone market. $AAPL||
$AAPL by far has any correlation with $CRUS anymore. They are semi-conductor company for audio chips. $AAPL has already admitted they have moved further away from companies like $CRUS, $QCOM, $LITE, etc. The media keeps trying to associate OLD news with today's news. Buy the Dip.||

Interesting $aapl  ||
$AAPL recovering, FAANG up big...but biggest news to me is $FB seems to have found bottom and also didn't run up gains with the rest of the market today, yet the MACD is signaled and the floor is there. Great value on $FB, good potential to rip to $153 before any minor pullbacks.||
Are you that blind he had massive losses and here you are telling everyone he's the best. Last couple of months this guy has been a train wreck $DDD $AAPL $NVDA $GS $TSLA and many more all documented||

$AAPL Needed that AH capitulation about two hours ago||
Next resistance for $AAPL on a H1 chart is 187.18 where the declining to flat 5 Day MA is (130 SMA on hourly or 65 SMA on 30 mins). This is if it continues over above the gap fill.||

Did you had a chance to look at the AAPL on daily ? Today's close looks like Dragonfly doji to me. Would like to have your opinion on this||
Apple Inc (AAPL) price at close, 2018-12-03, is 184.82.||
People won't wait for over a year for #Apple #iPhone #5G ...the telcos are desperate, they certainly won't wait... Market is ripe for #Samsung, #Google #pixel, #Xiaomi and other #Android heads of state... If true, this is no good for $AAPL, they'll fall even further behind...  ||
