@smartertrader Amazing how many people still don't see where we are in the market. Every day we pop and go lower. EVERY. DAY. Sure it may turn around, but when? When $AAPL is 130? $GS 120? $AMZN at 1000?|| @jimcramer all the people dumping AAPL do understand everyone will need an upgraded phone for 5g?|| $AAPL dispute with $QCOM is putting the company at great risk of being left out of the upcoming massive 5G upgrade cycle. They need $QCOM technology magnitudes more than $QCOM needs them as customer. In any event $AAPL must pay to use extensive $QCOM 5G patents. #Settlenow|| Great interview as always, your on target, but I disagree with you on $AAPL and $AMZN. $aapl will head to $100 and $AMZN will be back up.|| $AAPL -35% $FB -43% $AMZN -33% $ADBE -25% $NFLX -42% $NVDA -56% $GOOGL -23% The stocks have broken down and began breaking down some time ago #stocks || I disagree. All stocks are affected. Its just some more than others. $AAPL has real valuation in cash, of course. But if the FED didnt pump the economy, there would be fewer buyers for $700 phones. And AAPL may the the cheapest of the FAANG. NFLX ihas been outrageously priced.|| I was about to pull the trigger. It is tempting when you see $aapl down to $150 from $230.|| $AAPL no bottom $GS no bottom $FB no bottom $NVDA no bottom Others are starting.

Winning Option Swing Trades Since 2006 $AMZN $AAPL $WMT $NFLX|| $AAPL cycle from $186.08 peak is showing 5 swings sequence favoring more weakness against $172.60 high next week #Elliottwave #Apple|| If you bought $AAPL at $150 and $AAPL then fell to $120 in the next 2-3 weeks, it would then likely rebound to $165 in the 2-3 weeks that followed that. So even in a stock-crash scenario like 2008, this would be a good place to buy. Even for a short-term trade.|| If $AAPL followed the financial crisis EVEN w/o the 20% rebound that occurred in September 08, and fell to a low of $120 a share from a peak $233, it would then likely rebound to $165 in 10-15 days thereafter. This is why at this point, $AAPL is a winning trade at $150.|| This is important b/c $AAPL has not even seen a 10% bounce yet since its peak. I'm extremely confident that even if $AAPL were in the middle of FINANCIAL CRSIS 2.0, a rebound of significant magnitude is coming. And the further $AAPL falls from here, the larger the rebound.|| My table complete ignores any 10% bounce. Notice that this $AAPL table I've posted is only looking at bounces that are 15-16% or greater. And in some cases, I'm even ignoring 20% rebounds. The two bold-faced rows ignore rebounds that were 20%+ between peak and bottom.|| Notice that $AAPL is now in the 56th day of this correction. That is a very long period of time to go straight down. It is now also down 35%. This places the current crash among $AAPL's largest sell-offs. Each of the other big ones -- including F.C. -- lead to a massive rebound.|| The closest thing we've ever seen $AAPL do in terms of post-crash consolidation was the January 2008 crash. $AAPL fell 43.13% over 41-sessions, and then rebounded 65.53% over the ensuing 56-days. It took 10-weeks for $AAPL to rebound (part of that was consolidation).|| Notice the trend shows that there is no such thing as an $AAPL correction or crash without a coinciding massive rebound that IMMEDIATELY follows. There's no crash > sideways for months > rally. That doesn't exist.|| Even if one ignored 20% bounces, the two big pre-crisis era corrections went for 33.21% over 53-days b/f $AAPL then rebounded 28% over the next 28-days (2006) and the financial crisis $AAPL fell 52.3% in 39-days and rebounded 36% in the 14-days that followed.|| What are you getting at LULU and AAPL, I picked up multiple pairs of air pods for the crew here|| AAPL les analystes restent optimistes  || Independent Bank Ma (INDB) Shareholder Endurance Wealth Management Trimmed Its Position by $1.45 Million Callahan Advisors Cut Stake in Apple Computer (AAPL) by $1.01 Million - D Minute || During the financial crisis, $AAPL didn t go straight down from peak in August to bottom in October. There was a big 30% rebound that split the sell-off in two distinct legs.|| I m putting together an $AAPL corrections table right now and the early data shows that even by financial crisis standards of selling, $AAPL is due for a 20-30% bounce. Even by the financial crisis standards. As $AAPL fell 60%, it had multiple 20-30% bounces in-between.|| $AAPL is getting close.|| Generals Are Fleeing.
