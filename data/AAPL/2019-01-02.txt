IMO similar to Intel chips and MSFT OSs the upgrades no longer differentiate enough to make you run out and buy. Especially, at a $1000 a pop.|| My Predictions AAPL Between $60 - $100 NFLX Between $145 - $190 NVDA Between $95 - $105|| their installed unit base has grown by 100M in 2018 + they have 130B of cash on the balance sheet. They could have sacrificed margins & ramped up discounting, but maintained discipline instead. $AAPL #AAPL #Apple #StockMarket|| Breathtaking, blindsiding, whiplashing how quickly trillion-dollar-cap euphoria for Apple dissolved into this Apple-is-finished panic with this after-hours plunge, the stock is down 37% in three months. Read @ShiraOvide on this $AAPL #iPhone #China #TimCook|| Apple (AAPL) Lowers Q1 Guidance Street Insider   via @Street_Insider|| What's most important is that $AAPL changed is guidance only slightly lower, but the stock dropped a lot. This means there is still lots of fear in the market. I think any other stock could be next, and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that (and is exiting early).|| and funny you ignored the 6 or so tweets in a row i showed u with Kass shorting AAPL higher and higher|| I think it bounces ak $nflx post earnings. This 8 percent rev miss should already be priced in the stock. $lite guided $aapl 3d business down 35 percent Nov 12|| What F going on $aapl. Please someone explain to me.|| $NFLX $AAPL  || $IBM v $AAPL Monthly Chart - #AAPL chart  || How long can CNBC go on about AAPL tonight? It s Jeopardy time now.|| @DougKass I have less sympathy for you when trolls and haters come at you because of the way you act when Aapl goes down and you celebrate and mock Buffett|| Can $aapl now not do the short term thing and lay off silicon people ??|| $AAPL shot themselves when they raised iPhoneX above $1000 last year. $1000 is psych number on people. Myself and many I know who used to change every 2-3 years, don't have plan to change now until their phone gets broken or so. Apple is killing demand, not consumers.|| People need to calm the FK down 84 billion in revenue instead of 89 billion. Record quarter coming up. #AAPL|| It took $AAPL 14 years to reach ATH. How long will it take to retrace >80% and then up again? Are you going to wait and then hold another 20 years? (Crazy time frames of traditional stocks).|| A guy on CNBC said aapl 350|| Trying to keep up with the feed What does Mitt Romney think of $AAPL ???|| And yet you held $AAPL from $230 to $146 and $TSLA from $380 to $305. That is piss poor risk management.|| I had no idea how much money they were making off of new Netflix subscribers alone. Now that Netflix has recently changed the way these subscribers sign-up (hint it's not through the app store) $aapl will definitely be taking a hit there too. Just my two cents...|| Holding $AMZN $AAPL puts ...|| $AAPL price to earnings is now 12x. Huge buying opportunity. If Apple is smart (and of course they are) they will aggressively buy back undervalued shares. This said, it does feel like a new era for Apple. Transformation from growth stock into a dividend gusher is now complete.|| I see buy the dip folks on $AAPL...you all have fun with that. Better off throwing your money into a burning barrel and torching it. #Timestamp|| If you want in $BRK it ll probably take a descent hit tomorrow on this bad $AAPL news tonight. I saw this coming a mile away.|| This market simply cant rally without $AAPL  || $AAPL the best thing about this $AAPL fade will be the FX reverberations. breaking key resitances once and for all.|| Can you make $AAPL great again please? . @realDonaldTrump|| For 2019 I ve given up all social media for the entire year. Keeping twitter though lol. Why? Well because this is real time data lol. #stocks #trading $spy $qqq $aapl $amzn|| Show us where the MM touched you. Or do they just call them Algos now? $AAPL  || Waiting for the brilliance on TV talking heads about how they went short appl at the top today, or someone else with their 'unusual' options activity commentary...(currently, Iv'e no position in aapl)|| Your trade policy is excellent You wiped out $50B+ of market cap today in aapl.|| But they seem to know the difference between an $AAPL and a lemon  || My twits about #apple $aapl barely made it to anybody. Twitter algorithm didn't think it was that important. Everything I said just came true after the #market closed and could of saved some people from losing.|| $AMZN falls $40 after hours on #bad $AAPL news|| 'It's a dark day for Apple,' says analyst Dan Ives  #AAPL|| $aapl took out the previous low 146.6 after hrs.

Not because I hate them or anything, but I do think they have become complacent and too reliant on their app store revenue. Time to get laser focused on hardware again or the rest of the tech will leave them behind...|| A couple months ago, I would ve told you that $AAPL is easily the  safest stock  around. lolsob nothing is safe. Keep everything in cash? Nah, don t do that either. That stuff becomes more worthless every day. The only way to overcome a crap economy is to HUSTLE. No free lunches.|| $AAPL falling heavily - looks like some turbulence tomorrow. If they can put out a profit warning, nobody is safe|| $AAPL Apple resumes trade near $148/share after warning about Q1 results || $AAPL Puffet the biggest bagholder|| @tim_cook did a wonderful job here. I ll be buying more #AAPL when the market opens tomorrow. This is great leadership.|| Slow down is apparent from Cook of $AAPL. Will Fed stop QT and hikes or R they lost in their model?|| Those don't come out until around Feb 14th. $AAPL could be much higher by then.|| Brace yourselves. Tomorrow is gonna suck. $AAPL will bring the major indexes down with it. China continues to take us down. If our Gov t still thinks this isn t a global economy ... argh #markets #finance #investing #trade || $AAPL getting crushed is not a sign of tech weakness. It is a sign of hardware centric weakness. We should see shifts in $$to software plays like $BOX, $ZUO, $VIPS.....also surgical HW plays are awesome like $PSTG, $CRAY .... $AMZN should still be attractive.|| "Peter the Deleter" just tweeted his new TA on aapl flush to $46, you still fading him? time to go balls deep?|| What s dangerous for $aapl in , is good for WeChat stickiness $tcehy || When will ge replace aapl In the Dow?|| Feeling like an idiot for getting BTFD $AAPL call options @205 strike a few weeks ago. Expiring worthless, but at least my loss was contained.|| The current dividend yield on $AAPL stock is 1.85%. Apple has plenty of cash to boost the div, to offset some of the stock's plunge. But there's a problem If Apple hikes the div substantially Wall St will see it as an admission of weak growth prospects.  || She, and others, all blaming China, the Fed, and Trump. No one blames Tim Cook and AAPL. Or even the analysts covering AAPL that were reluctant to cut estimates.|| With #AAPL down, today was the wrong day to go all in on iCoins.|| The stock market is fucking wild yo y all react to anything come on AAPL|| Yep, gonna be scrounging for spare change under the cushions of mom's basement couch tonight to quadruple down. $AAPL|| Everyone assuming Buffet will sit pat or wil be adding. Let me tell you something. If filings come out from BRK and hes reduced or sold some, $AAPL may go sub 120 and even sub 100 eventually.|| $aapl has shed almost TWO $BA's in market cap. $msft cruising, down approx 16% from high. Why does market pivot on APPLE? @CNBCFastMoney @GuyAdami @ScottWapnerCNBC|| In my defense I did close a VXX long and ULTA short at the open. But really the market was not acting well. The way this $AAPL situation is being handled feels fraudulent. Currencies are going apeshit currently with Yen getting a safety bid if I understand the action correctly.|| This idea worked for $BTC and #crypto... will it work for traditional stocks / $AAPL? hmmm  || $AAPL How many companies did Apple just warn for tonight.|| It was hilarious how they cut off the only bear on AAPL immediately and played nonstop interview with Cook to see if that help the carnage that is coming.|| Breaking Nasdaq set to open 5% up after Speaker @NancyPelosi and the new House pass new budget bill including $25B for Iphones, Teslas, and Netflix subscriptions for all federal employees and $1B for border security (not a wall). $AAPL $TSLA $NFLX $SPY $QQQ $FAANG|| @orionstafa $aapl.
