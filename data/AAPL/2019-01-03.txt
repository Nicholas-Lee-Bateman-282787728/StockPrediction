But cheaper than mine doesn t it is a deal or vice versus and half of them are failures. Eg, $aapl put price was all over the place. Need to focus on risk reward and charts & setups.|| Disappointing + $592.20 on $AAPL + $161.59 on $BMY  via @YouTube|| When they had a $200 + target on $AAPL yesterday did they feel that way ?|| $Aapl will be $130 next couple weeks|| The only reason $AAPL has so much in cash reserves is because the company avoids paying tax in every country it sells its products Happy to see Buffett affected by the downturn Buying opportunity soon|| $AAPL near term $140 bounce IMHO|| People invest in stock hope the company will grow. If apple revenue or profit decrease, and see no growing potential, no surprise that aapl drops.|| I am mostly flat now but my current trade themes (not advice) are 1) Long H 2200 SP put vs Short M 2000 SP put ~ -5d live 2) Long H 150 $NFLX puts 3) Long $AAPL buy write vs 30 day 40d call.

Way to do this is thru market share gains vs android which means lower priced handsets, not raising them. Everything needs to come down $150- $200 and an even cheaper model for EM.  || Sure, and the world could end tomorrow as well. Come on man, at least be realistic.

They can buy it cheaper now than before|| $AAPL is ONLY going to make $84 Billion this QUARTER. They should be ashamed.
