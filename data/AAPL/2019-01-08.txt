Oh really? They ripped off everything from Apple Before the iPhone came out, all Samsung made were those crappy plastic flip phones.

Icahn got his "Goose the stock Trade" and left the building. Just shameful that $AAPL actually got bullied in the first place.  || I d call the $AAPL interview a flop, not a single interesting statement made by Tim Cook|| today he was saying "we have an amazing product pipeline" like a new iphone? has aapl come out with anything other than the watch since the iphone?|| Maybe yet they hire really smart people $AAPL|| Tim Cook said the XR has been the most popular $AAPL iphone every single day since they started shipping until now|| Tim Cook made over $15 million in 2018   that's 283 times more than the median Apple employee earned (AAPL) || One of the challenges of worldwide patent enforcement is the relative dilution of impact for incremental victories in terms of driving settlement. $QCOM's own touting of these injunctions appears to have backfired, and $AAPL's resolve to fight is apparently undimmed.|| @sinv excuses? nope merely giving advice for aapl fans. they need to shout it out. Meanwhile I trade it on the long side until he brks it|| @OldFngGuy Ur applying arguments to me which are not mine... Do U assume $AAPL has never been my largest position? If so ur wrong. LOL|| Probably been mentioned already today but Samsung struggles only further prove $AAPL s issues are almost solely China related. Can be fixed or at worst adjusted.|| It's a trick to get me to throw my laptop out the window, so then I'll have to buy a new one #AAPL|| The only case to make for AAPL is the low PE and the dividend. As Dan has said, the phone business is now in a downturn and will be for several years. I don't see any positive fundamentals for AAPL. If the stock gets back up above $160, I would be looking to short it.|| Holy Crap Tim Cook on Cramer wow unreal next up Warren B buys more $AAPL you cant make this stuff up|| Start investing with Acorns today Get $5 when you use my invite link  #stocks #investing #money #IRA $ACRL $AAPL|| If you remember, AAPL had a similar issue way back. Only CS was "on line". As they evolved they vastly improved.

As a company, they are far more innovative than anything $AAPL Absent IOS, $AAPL is pure garbage @tim_cook|| @tim_cook what possibly does $AAPL stand to gain by you going on Mad Money ...|| Just saying that comparing iPods costing $200 vs. Apple Watch costing $1,000 is a bogus comparison of Apples to Oranges. Apple CEO needs to compare Apples to Apples. $AAPL =^.^-  || @jimcramer interview w/ @tim_cook is scary. He s either delusional, confused or not self-aware. $AAPL hasn t invented a product in years. They copy & upgrade. Loyalty will only carry you so far. Starting to sound like $GE. Where is the AI? Where is Cloud? Where is anything new?|| The funny part is $AAPL thought the $2 discount/chip from $QCOM was more attractive than using $INTC chips How can anyone say $QCOM was forcing Apple to use its chips to squash competition as the @FTC is claiming.|| Huge block volume 12/31 on AAPL at 158.35.|| $AAPL needs to innovate again. there has been no pressing technological improvements in the last few years. They keep this up, and they will be the new $IBM.|| $AAPL sorry Tim C... all I want to hear about is why U didn't spend 150B on M&A vs. buying back stock too high??|| $AAPL worrisome attitude frm cook. he is not rushed 2get the sales now.

NOT units sold Just sayin'. =^.^=|| nothing has changed @tim_cook - you are a dreary, dull person who knows/appreciates little of capital markets & $aapl shareholder interests  || No offense, Mr. Cramer But...isn't this a little pathetic. You know, when the CEO of $AAPL needs to go on @CNBC and tout his products and equity for the little "dip buyers" at home? This screams desperate. Big time.

ZERO memory on these phones as well. #BigFatUglyBubble investors are still there and are as brainless as ever|| Cook lists "longest batter life in an iphone" as part of the list of innovation. they need a new leader. $AAPL|| $AAPL is $151 today... about $85 off 52wk highs.
