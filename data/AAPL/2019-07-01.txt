In 2016, you'd watch a crappy NFLX film or series because you couldn't find anything else. Not gonna happen in 2020 with DIS+, ramped Hulu, ramped T/HBO, AAPL and more. All that mediocre NFLX content will be worth 0.|| We have to remember that the majority of $NFLX content spend is still on re-runs. And then a decent amount is on original films and originals (films & series) for overseas countries. It's very possible that $AAPL will have more US series hits than NFLX in 2020.|| via GerberKawasaki Another very solid day in the stock market. Nice gains across the board.
