Strange disconnect in the narrative|| The solution isn't regulation is is antitrust of MSM. For example, @twxcorp, spin off CNN. We have huge media monopolies which control all aspects of our information this needs to end. W/ GOOG, spin off YouTube, etc. @thejusticedept break up Media Monopolies|| Tech sector also in the same boat... e.g FB, MSFT, Goog, AAPL Stocks just few dollars away from monthly support. Since AMZN & NFLX are near all time high , those 2 are closer to weekly/daily support.
